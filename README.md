Since the introduction of **0DTE SPX** options, modelling the SPX volatility surface has become incredibly complex due to highly opinionated IV curve shapes and tight bid-ask spreads. This repo contains the code accompanying my [ETH Mathematics Master's thesis](https://github.com/JPNotleks/VolaDiff/blob/main/VolaDiff%20Thesis.pdf), which investigates the daily variation of the volatility surface by decomposing its dynamics into an endogenous maturation of the surface, and an exogenous volatility shock. *VolaDiff* is a diffusion model capable of learning the distribution of implied total variance shocks since 2022 by leveraging a rigorous approach to unconditional diffusion. A novel conditioning mechanism allows *VolaDiff* to condition on **arbitrary alpha signals**: by feeding VolaDiff a data loader which resamples from the k-nearest neighbours of any target condition, it generates sensible, arbitrage-free generalisations of observed market conditions. These forecasts can be used by SPX/NDX/RUT market makers to **assess vega exposure** across the entire surface, **forecast VIX futures and volatility derivatives**, and perform **scenario generation**.

Various technical details regarding the diffusion architecture and a precise definition of volatility shocks can be found in the [VolaDiff Thesis PDF](https://github.com/JPNotleks/VolaDiff/blob/main/VolaDiff%20Thesis.pdf), in particular on pages 10-11. Installation and usage are straightforward; see the [**main.ipynb**](https://github.com/JPNotleks/VolaDiff/blob/main/main.ipynb) file for a precise demo of how to train and sample from the diffusion model.
